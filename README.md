## Hello and welcome to my GitHub account
I am passionate about everything that is software development and problem-solving. As a final-year Applied Computer Science student, I have honed my ability to learn new skills and technologies effectively and apply them practically right away. 

I take pride in delivering my best on every project, and thinking of out of the box solutions. With strong project management skills, I collaborate well with people from all around the world on a daily basis. Not only that, but I am always punctual, trustworthy and always strive to make a positive impact in everything I do.

### Major Prior Projects
Over the last few years I have worked on a number of large projects, because these projects each contained multiple repositories I turned them into organizations here on GitHub, I will describe each one briefly and link them below.

#### Bandit Games
During this project we worked on creating a platform that can host multiplayer board games where users could become friends, buy games, see their statistics for games they played, chat with a chatbot to help navigate the platform and of course most importantly play games. This project also found us creating a flagship game to host on our platform, for which we chose to implement battleship.

Our platform's goal was to make it as easy as possible for a user to create an account and start playing games with friends right away, which is why we focussed greatly on the user experience. On the same note, in order to make it appealing and easy for developers to integrate their games with our platform, we made an SDK for them to use in order to easily integrate with us while keeping ownership of their own code.

You can watch the platform in action [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r9aVZ8N3GHZHxB3ZbMGN4kdECHUBnohC/view)!

#### Kiosk Application
During this project we worked on creating a platform that was tasked with engaging young people in local elections and generally gathering their opinions. Our goal was to work for a real company, Tree Company and Levuur in order to create a product that closely matched their description.

#### Room Sense
During this project we were tasked with creating a project aimed at addressing real-life challenges while making use of Arduino technology. Our goal was to boost global productivity and well-being by optimizing work and living environments.

We developed a multi-sensor device to collect data, which is then displayed on our website. The site provides real-time feedback, optimal room usage recommendations, warnings, ventilation signals, and graphs illustrating data trends over time.
